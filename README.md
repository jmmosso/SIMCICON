# SIMCICON
The Cyber Conflict Simulator 

Developed a simulator for Cyber Conflict (CICON) to support the analysis of different issues linked to 
modern conflict from the perspective of cyberspace based on the 2015 project "Cyber Conflict Simulation". 

SIMCICON serves the purpose of analyzing issues related to conflict theory, doctrine, TTPs, tools and human 
resources linked to different operations in cyberspace. It is a project aimed at consolidating a software platform 
for processes of analysis, research and training of personnel involved in cyber defense tasks. 

The software considers both, traditional OT Networks and Operational Networks (OT) through the concept 
of Critical Infrastructure.
